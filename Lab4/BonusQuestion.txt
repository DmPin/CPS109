Write a short program (using functions) that will take a list of strings
and print them off in a "stair case" pattern. The length of the list and 
the strings are both accepted as user input. Have the prompt loop until the 
user enters -1 as their list length.

Here is an example:

>>> How many words are in this list?
>>> 5
>>> Enter word 1: The
>>> Enter word 2: black
>>> Enter word 3: cat
>>> Enter word 4: went
>>> Enter word 5: meow.

The
    black
        cat
            went
                meow.

>>> How many words are in this list?
>>> 2
>>> Enter word 1: Hello
>>> Enter word 2: world!

Hello
    World!

>>> How many words are in this list?
>>> -1
>>> Goodbye!
```
