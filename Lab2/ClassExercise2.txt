'''
Write a program that takes a user's input. If the user's input is divisible
by 10, it will print "base 10". If the user's input is divible by 8, print 
"base 8". If the input is divisible by both 8 and 10, print "woah crazy!"
This program should only deal with positive numbers. If the number is less than
0, throw an error.

This program should keep prompting the user for input until they enter -1.

Examples:
>>> Enter a number: 20
>>> Base 10
>>> Enter a number: 24
>>> Base 8
>>> Enter a number: -29
>>> Error: protocol not defined for negative numbers!
>>> Enter a number: -1
>>> Goodbye!
