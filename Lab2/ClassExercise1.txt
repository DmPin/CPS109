Write a program that takes a user's input, then converts it to a letter
grade. For example, 90-100 is an A+, 50-60 is a D, etc. The program will
throw an error if the user does not enter a number in the range of 0 to
100.

Examples:

>>> Enter your grade percentage: 90
>>> You got an A+

>>> Enter your grade percentage: 40
>>> You got an F
