'''
Write a function that takes a string as its only argument. Have the function
print out the string with its letters in alphabetical order, then reverse 
alphabetical order. In your main block, call this function on user input until
the user enters -1. The user can enter combined letters and numbers in their string.
Trim any white space (spaces, tabs, etc.) out.

Example:

>>> Enter a string: Cassandra
>>> Alphabetical: aaaCdnrss
>>> Reverse alphabetical: ssrndCaaa
>>> Enter a string: A string!
>>> Alphabetical: Aginrst!
>>> Reverse alphabetical: !tsrnigA
>>> Enter a string: -1
>>> Goodbye!
