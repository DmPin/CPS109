'''
Write a function that takes two arguments: a positive integer and a string.
Split up the string into slices of the integer's size and add them to a list.
Print off the list. In the main block, this function should be called until
the user enters -1. Do not assume that the user will enter postive integers.

Example:

>>> Enter a string you'd like to split: This is a string!
>>> Enter the number of characters in each split: 3
>>> Output: ["Thi", "s i", "s a", " st", "rin", "g"]
>>> Enter a string you'd like to split: Another string...
>>> Enter the number of characters in each split: -10
>>> Invalid input!
>>> Enter a string you'd like to split: Another string...
>>> Enter the number of characters in each split: 5
>>> Output: ["Anoth", "er st", "ring.", ".."]
>>> Enter a string you'd like to split: -1
>>> Goodbye!
